### **Project Title:**
Catching Up and Leveling Off: A Dynamic Simulation of How Temporary Learning Rate Boosts Generate Larger Effects for Low-Achievers

### **Project Description:**
We hypothesize that interventions targeting foundational learning skills have a disproportionately large impact on low-achievers by temporarily increasing their learning rate, leading to a period of accelerated catch-up growth. Our simulation models student learning trajectories over multiple time points, where a treated group of low-achievers receives a temporary, decaying boost to their learning rate, with all growth constrained by a mastery ceiling. We expect to find that the effect size of the intervention is not static; it peaks at an intermediate time point before declining due to the combined forces of effect decay and students approaching the mastery ceiling. This peak effect for the targeted low-achiever group is substantially larger than what would be observed in a general population or measured in a simple pre-post design, which often underestimates the intervention's true potential. Ultimately, this research underscores the limitations of static evaluation models and argues for the necessity of longitudinal studies to accurately capture the time-dependent dynamics of interventions that change *how* students learn.
